Seasons Greetings!</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>How time flies when we're having fun! We look back at 2009 and see all we accomplished, and we look forward to a very busy 2010.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>We lost three very valuable helpers at the museum this past year: Ruth Werner, our secretary; Mary Wintermeyer, our historian; and Bill Wintermeyer, who retired.  These shoes are hard to fill but we must. Please let us know if you're interested in becoming involved with our society. We really need new ideas and energy.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>A big project we finished this past year, thanks to Bill Klopfenstein, is a new wall in the schoolroom area.  It's much lighter now and greatly improved.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>Have you seen the new, to us, display case in our entry?  Formally, it was used in the Huston and Mathews Drug Store and we're grateful to now have it in the museum.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>There are beautiful new postcards of Winfield now available at the museum.  We're selling them as a fundraiser at 6 for $5.00 or a dollar each.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>Our railroad program continues to be information packed and we encourage you to attend again this year, Feb 15th at the Winfield High School at 1 PM.  We're also planning a program on Photography Old and New on March 22nd at 7 PM. Bob Lindell is finishing a book on the Boy Scouts that we're hoping will turn into a program and books available for sale at the museum.  Stay tuned.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>2010 will be fun packed as we hope to get a display case built to house our military memorabilia.  We're fortunate to have some uniforms, etc., donated and with proper display we can share them with our community.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>We will be making a small documentary movie of the History of Winfield this year.  We have to present it in Mt Pleasant in 2011, so push has come to shove.  More information will be available as this big project develops.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>Your continuing support is vital and gratefully appreciated.  Please remember the museum when estate planning.  All contributions, financial and otherwise, keep our history alive for future generations.</B></FONT></P>
