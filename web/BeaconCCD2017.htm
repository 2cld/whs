<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This story is about
being thankful; thankful for family; thankful for friends; thankful for their
community and thankful for life. As Lindy commented, &ldquo;First and last, thank you
to everyone.&rdquo;</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Colonel R.L. (Retired
Air Force) and Lillian (Jones) Chrisinger have been chosen to serve as the
Ambassadors for the 2017 Crooked Creek Days. Both have spent most of their
lives in the Winfield area, Lil coming from Columbus Junction and Chris from
Winfield.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The couple met in
Columbus Junction at a Louisa County 4-H party. As Lindy says, &ldquo;I winked at the
most beautiful girl in the room and Lil Jones joined in the refreshment line;
that was 73 years ago.&rdquo; They have been married 65 of those years.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Lil was 18 years
old and with one summer of education classes, she taught eighth grade in a
country school. She went on to get her four-year degree in education and
finished her career at the Columbus Community School System when she retired in
1991. Since that time, she has filled in substitute teaching at several of the
area schools.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Together, Lindy and
Lil have three children, Jim, John and Ann. They also have three grandchildren
and two great-grandchildren.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindy was born and
raised on the family farm in northeast Henry County the son of Durbin and Signe
Lindeen Chrisinger. Lindy&rsquo;s grandfather, Robert V. Chrisinger had bought the
farm in 1868 and Lindy was born and raised there with his two siblings, John
and Evelyn, both now deceased.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1946 Lindy&rsquo;s
father, Durbin and two partners created an airport at the farm. At the age of
16, Lindy was flying a J-3 Piper Cub airplane, never dreaming this would be
useful about 10 years later to take photos of crops to show farmers at winter
meetings.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In September of 1947
Lindy and his brother John E. drove the two Ford Model T&rsquo;s John owned to Ames,
the home of Iowa State University to attend school.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in the
spring of 1948, Russia and China were insisting on World War III. Thousands of
young males (not 19 year olds) enlisted for one-year active duty to have their
choice of Army, Navy, Air Force or other military services. &ldquo;We made the
choice,&rdquo; said Lindy, &ldquo;because at the age of 17 and 18, we would soon be
involved.&rdquo;</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindy chose the Air
Force and after 13 weeks of basic training in Texas, the rest of the year was
spent at Sacramento, CA&rsquo;s Mather Air Force Base. &ldquo;For nine months, I worked at
the top level of Base Headquarters taking care of Military Regulations and
Letters,&rdquo; Lindy said. Fortunately, World War III did not happen, but
unfortunately, the Korean War did. &ldquo;I spent that time at Ames due to my
involvement with AF ROTC. In December of 1952, I became an Air Force Reserve 2<sup>nd</sup>
Lieutenant and the Air Force had Lieutenants coming out of their ears. I did
not go on active duty as my classmates did with no prior active duty.&rdquo;</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Col. Chrisinger has a
plaque he received for his service as the &ldquo;Outstanding Liason Officer in the
Nation 1978&rdquo;.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 15, 1952, Lil
and Lindy were married on a very hot day at the Columbus Junction Methodist
Church where Lil was a member of the choir. Lil recalled the day, &ldquo;It was so
hot that as the men arrived for the wedding, they were told that they could
remove their jackets because it was so hot.&rdquo; But then Lindy chimed in, &ldquo;except
for those of us in the wedding party. We had to wear our jackets.&rdquo; They spent
their honeymoon in Mark Twain country in Mid-Missouri, just west of the
Mississippi River.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Back on campus at
Iowa State, Lindy completed his B.S. education in Agronomy and employment in
research legume breeding. Lil was also employed and their first son, Jim Durbin
was on the way.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following Lindy&rsquo;s graduation
from Iowa State University in December of 1952, Lil and Lindy took up residency
in Marion, Ohio where Lindy was well employed by Allied Chemical and Dye Corp.
in sales which included educating dealers and their farm customers on using
nitrogen commercial fertilizer to replace farm manure and legumes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their first child, Jim, was born on March 18,
1953 and the Chrisingers moved to Winfield on Thanksgiving that year. Lil also had
their second son, John Corey &ldquo;getting a start in her tummy.&rdquo;</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moving back to
Winfield, the Chrisingers rented part of a house from Miss Della Johnson on
East Elm Street. Their second son, John C. was born May 18<sup>th</sup>, 1954. </big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1958, the
Chrisinger &ldquo;5&rdquo; moved to 410 South Locust Street where Lil and Lindy still
reside.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 12, 1956,
Ann Benae Chrisinger was born to complete their wonderful family. A few years
later, Lil and some kids with a child&rsquo;s four-wheel wagon helped move books to
the new and present Winfield Library.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindy&rsquo;s sales
territory was the North one-third of Illinois and also some involvement in
Iowa.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After working with
other fertilizer companies, Chris Soil Service was born in 1956. Lindy attended
many conferences in Des Moines, Ames and even at the University of Illinois in
Urbana.</big></p>




<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 24pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindy has also been
involved with the Scouting program in Winfield, serving as Winfield&rsquo;s
Neighborhood Commissioner. This meant that if the City was short of Scout
leaders, it was his job to find one, whether that meant visiting a city council
meeting or a school board meeting. His three children, Jim, John and Ann have
also been active in Camp Eastman Scout Camp as one year they all worked at the
camp. Son Jim earned his Eagle Scout award and served several times as Chief at
Camp Eastman.</big></p>

place in the parade.</big></p>
