  <p align="left"><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>The C.B.&amp;
Q. Railroad (Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy), according to what
records I have, was built in 1878 by the Burlington Northwestern Narrow
Gauge Railroad, a very narrow gauge track. The standard gauge track was
eventually built by the C. B. &amp; Q. in 1902. The tracks ran north
and west from Burlington through the towns of Atlanta, Sperry,
Mediapolis, Roscoe, Yarmouth, Mount Union, Winfield, Wyman,
Crawfordsville and Washington, Iowa. Just north of Winfield, a set of
tracks branched west from the main line through the towns of Wayne
(about a mile north of Olds), Wayland, Coppock, Keota, Harper,
Sigourney, Delta, and Atwood, before ending up in Oskaloosa, Iowa.</b></font></p>

  <p align="center"><b><font face="Courier New" size="+1">Personal Experiences and Knowledge of the C. B. &amp; Q.</font></b></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>As a little kid, the train
was an important part of my daily life. There wasn't much to do, so you
had to make your own fun. My thanks to the C. B. &amp; Q.</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>I was born in 1925 and have
many fond memories involving the railroad. When I was about
three-years-old, my mother would take me to Winfield to ride a trolley
or a one car passenger train that was run by a man named Claude Pierce
who was a resident of Winfield. From Winfield, we would ride to the
town of Wyman where her father, John Cannon, would pick us up in a
horse and wagon to visit he and Grandma Cannon on their farm about two
miles west of Wyman. Many times Mom would pack a picnic lunch for the
trip. Claude would ask me to come up and ride with him in the engine
part of the train. At the time I was shy and didn't want to leave my
mom, so I wouldn't go, but ever since then, I wish like heck I would
have taken him up on the offer!</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>When I was eleven-years-old
I would help Grandpa Cannon drive cattle from the same farm west of
Wyman to the stockyard to be loaded by rail and shipped to market from
Wyman to Chicago, Illinois. Grandpa used to raise fat cattle and since
there weren't any trucks to haul the animals we would walk them into
town where about twenty-five head (weighing about a thousand pounds
apiece) would be loaded on boxcars and shipped to be slaughtered at the
Union Stockyards in Chicago. When you paid the freight for the animals,
you also got a ticket to ride to the city with them.</b></font></p>

  <p><font color="Blue" face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>I remember the
year 1943 in particular. I was eighteen years old and just graduated
from Winfield High School. Back then, when a cattleman paid for a load
of cattle to be taken by rail to Chicago, he was given a pass to ride
along. My grandpa Cannon talked Dutch Oldt, the depot agent, into
giving him two passes for the train, so I got to go along to sell these
cows. I remember we rode in a single passenger car that doubled as the
caboose. We left about one o'clock in the afternoon and were to pick up
more boxcars in Burlington, Iowa and Galesburg, Illinois. When we got
to Galesburg, I remember we stopped at a little place called The
Beanery for a sandwich before traveling on into Chicago. The same
afternoon after the cattle were sold, we returned to Union Station on
Adams Street to return home. Just by chance we got to ride on the new
Burlington Zephyr. Another cattleman, formerly from Winfield, was also
on the Zephyr; a fellow by the name of Burch Buffington. After speaking
with the conductor, he came and placed a sticker of the Burlington
Zephyr on my shirt-front.</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>Later that evening, when the
train pulled into the station in Burlington, we discovered Burlington's
Union Depot had burned down and the train going on to Winfield would
not be running that day. Grandpa and I had to spend the night at the
Union Hotel located across the street from the smoldering train depot.
The following morning, about 10 a.m., we were able to catch the
Washington, Iowa train that dropped me off in Winfield and Grandpa off
at Wyman. That was quite an experience for me.</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>On another trip to sell
cattle with my dad, Sam Kepper, when we had to stay all night before
coming home, we saw Ted Weems and his orchestra at The Chicago Theater.
That was another great experience for me.</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>In the summertime, when the
weather was good, the circus would come to town. This train would run
on Sunday so that it wouldn't interrupt the regular train schedule that
ran the rest of the week. There were elephants, giraffes, and all kinds
of wild animals that arrived by train. For me as a little kid, that was
really something to see!</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>Sometimes sparks from the
train engines would come out of the smoke stacks. I also remember one
summer as a child when these sparks caught a field of dry hay between
town and the Washington Bridge on fire. The whole field of twenty some
acres of hay was burned off. I don't know if the railroad made
restitution for the damage, but I do know that it was the railroad's
responsibility to build and maintain fences on both sides of the track.
This was not always the case and sometimes cattle would get out, walk
down the track and get out on the road.</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>In later years, my brother
raised thousands of turkeys that ranged in the fields near the tracks.
They, too, got on the track. When the train stopped to shew them off
the tracks even more flew onto the train and rode all the way to
Washington and back. Although the railroad said the birds had been
returned, some of the engineers may have gotten a free Thanksgiving or
Christmas turkey.</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>As a kid, for something to
do, we used to walk up and down the tracks a quarter mile south of our
house and sometimes find an occasional mushroom. More often, however,
if we could find a penny, we would put it on one of the rails and wait
for the train to come by and smash the penny flatter than a pancake. I
don't know what ever happened to those pennies.</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>In the summer when Crooked
Creek was high, some of the older boys from Winfield would walk the
tracks from town and jump or dive from the Washington Bridge into the
water. It was the local swimming hole and many of the boys took
advantage of the high water to go "skinny dipping" on a hot summer
afternoon. Some of those boys' names were: Barney Marshal, Chig Ball,
Willie Marshal, Tooley Honts, Socket Wilson, Hotsy Davis, Gag Long,
Poozy Peck and others.</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>Another quite common site to
see was a couple named John and Lula Evans, a local couple from
Winfield who liked to fish in their later years. They would walk out to
the Washington Bridge and fish for turtles as well as frogs and fish
for their dinner from the creek bank below. Whenever they caught a
turtle they would take it home and keep it in a ten gallon crock and
continue to feed the turtles scraps from their own meals. When a turtle
grew to be nice and fat they would then butcher the turtle and eat it.
I guess that was all right, but I always thought it was a little
unusual.</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Courier New" size="+1"><b>For 101 years the railroad
played an important part in the economy and growth of Winfield. For me,
personally, it also provided a world of wonder and fond memories for a
farm boy growing up in southeast Iowa.</b></font></p>
