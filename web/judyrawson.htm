<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ElegaGarmnd BT" SIZE="+1" COLOR="White"><B>Greetings from Winfield, Iowa,<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for visiting our web site and in so doing visiting our museum, too.  Our Historical Society is a dedicated group of people that hope to preserve our local history. As our world seems to turn faster and life styles change, we believe it important to save our rural heritage. We can all learn from symbols of the past and in so doing be inspired for the future.<BR>
<BR>
We encourage all like-minded people to become members of our society. In so doing, your dues will help finance our efforts to record and treasure the local history that is so fast disappearing. All donations are also welcome and tax deductable.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you,<BR>
Judy Rawson, Pres.
