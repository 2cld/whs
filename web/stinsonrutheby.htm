<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Born and raised in 
      the small town of Hartington, Nebraska, Ruth Eby attended Hastings College 
      (Hastings, NE) for a single year before enrolling at the Teacher's 
      College, University of Nebraska. Eby completed her Art Education degree 
      (BFA) in 1932 and that summer, attended the Stone City Art Colony. On 
      weekdays, Ruth supervised fifteen Cedar Rapids children who came for 
      morning art classes and picnic lunches; she also led Sunday classes for 
      children. Eby studied watercolors and oil painting as a colony student. 
      She lived on the third floor of the Green Mansion and was Pauline 
      Phelps Trask's roommate. While at the colony, she met her 
      future husband, Harry Stinson, an associate professor of art (specializing 
      in sculpture) at the University of Iowa who was one of the first students 
      in the United States to receive an M.F.A. degree (1940).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

Following her time 
      in the colony, Eby attended the University of Iowa, completing a Masters 
      degree in psychology and child welfare in 1934. Simultaneously, her 
      husband served as the Director of Sculpture for Iowa&#146;s WPA division under 
      Grant Wood. Ruth received a Carnegie Research Assistantship in art 
      psychology (1932-34) while a graduate student. The Stinsons remained at 
      the university until 1941 when Harry accepted an art faculty position at 
      Hunter College, SUNY. After retiring as a full professor in 1966, the 
      Stinsons remained in New York and then moved to San Diego, California in 
      1968.<BR>

In New York, Ruth 
      worked as an occupational therapist for St. Mary&#146;s Hospital for 
      Convalescent Children from 1942-1948. She continued her art education and 
      studied with Dong Kingman.Working in watercolors, acrylics, and oils, she 
      never exhibited professionally, choosing to pursue painting for its own 
      enjoyment. In her spare time, she was an avid seamstress and helped her 
      husband build a stone cottage for family vacations. In California, Ruth 
      was a member of the San Diego Archaelogical Society and participated in numerous digs. She    died in San Diego in 1993.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
