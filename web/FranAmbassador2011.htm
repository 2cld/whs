<P ALIGN="left">	<FONT SIZE="+1">Crooked Creek Days 2011 is set for August 5, 6 and 7, 2011. Each year, the annual celebration names a Grand Marshal/ Ambassador to lead the parade and to be honored for their years of service and commitment to the community.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	This year's recipient of the award goes to Frances (Fran) Lowe. Fran has been a member of the Winfield community all of her life, growing up one and a half miles west of Winfield. She was the only daughter of Robert and Elvira Evans. The Evans' had lost two daughters prior to Fran's birth and when they called to say that she was on the way, her father &quot;hitched up the team and buggy and drove to Mt. Pleasant.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	Fran is a 1945 graduate of Winfield High School. This is the first year that her class has not had their own reunion since their graduation. However, Fran commented that if and when classmates from away from the area come back, they will and do get together.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	In 1949, Fran was united in marriage to Leslie Lowe. At that time, they made their home two miles East of town. &quot;I was a big part of our farming operation,&quot; Fran says. &quot;I was on a tractor or in the hog/cattle barn as much as Les was, but I loved every minute of it.&quot; When the couple retired, they built a house inside the city limits of Winfield this time. Fran lost her life-time partner in 1993. She then sold her house and moved to the Westview Apartments where she currently resides.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	Fran is one of our Ambassadors who truly lived and played on Crooked Creek. She recalled that during her youth she and some of the neighbor kids (Jr. Rickey and Roger Williams) would ride their horses to the creek and wade in the water. &quot;We weren't supposed to,&quot; she said, but with a smile continued, &quot;but we did anyway.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	While doing this interview, Fran brought out three scrapbooks she had made while a chaperone for the Winfield Girls' Basketball teams. &quot;I started the scrapbooks in 1946 when Yarmouth went to the state tournaments,&quot; she said; she now has five books full of girls' basket-ball (and a few pages of boys' basketball). Some of the girls on the team while she was a chaperone were: Loretta Gipple, Karen Davis, Luella Bitting, Betty Kellogg Lintz, Judy Ross, Betty Ross Canby, Tana Paisley Jennings, just to name a few. The books are a delightful memory for Fran on days when she wants to reminisce with them. She says she enjoyed every second of her time with the girls and Coach Ray Brainard.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	When the season was over, Les and Fran would host a dinner at their home for the team. She gave up that position in the early 1960's. The girls' parents were included in the last dinner for a social time.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	Fran showed me a page in one of her scrapbooks that featured some of the Winfield basketball girls dancing at Vets in Des Moines. You ask, &quot;why were they dancing, shouldn't they be playing ball.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	The year was 1959. The team had traveled to Des Moines to watch the state basketball tournament. Unfortunately, as the fans were ready to leave at the end of the Saturday night games, Mother Nature had dropped a large blanket of snow, closing highways and stranding the fans in Des Moines. Making the best of a bad situation, the girls, and a few boys, played cards and danced all night. The caption beneath one of the pictures read as follows: &quot;While a real blizzard outside and heavy snow blocked the highways all over the state, these teenage girls' basketball fans held a huge dance and slumber party at Veterans' Memorial Auditorium Saturday night. Hundreds of girls, joined by an occasional boy, shed their shoes and danced the hours away on the basketball floor after some, from somewhere, produced some rock 'n roll records.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	Fran especially remembers this year as a chaperone as one of the special ones. &quot;I can't believe these girls are now grandmothers,&quot; she said.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	Just because Fran gave up the chaperone's job, does not mean she gave up sports. To this day Fran is seen sitting on the top row of seats at the Winfield-Mt. Union High School Gymnasium, and when the girls and boys made their trips to Des Moines several years ago, she was right there with them to celebrate their State Championships.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	Basketball is not the only sport that Fran enjoys. She has been an avid golfer for more than 58 years. She has been a member of Indian Hills Golf Course, Morning Sun, for many years. She even remembers one year she played in a couples tournament at Twin Lakes Country Club with Russ Allbaugh as her partner - and they won the tourney!</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	But back to the beginning of Fran's golfing: Les and Fran had traveled to St. Louis to see a Cardinals Baseball game with several of Les's Army buddies. One of the guys said something about golfing and Fran said that she had always wanted to learn the game. That was it - the next day they went to purchase clubs and the rest is history. Fran has also served as District Chairman for Iowa Women's Golf Association for Southeast Iowa for a number of years and to this day she continues to run into people she had worked with. &quot;I may not be able to say their name,&quot; she said, &quot;but I can tell you which golf course they belonged to.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	&quot;I don't play as much as I used to,&quot; she said, &quot;but I still enjoy golfing with my friends. I wouldn't take a million dollars for the friends I have made through playing golf.&quot; While she claims that the muscles and joints don't move like they used to, she still plays the game.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	Fran is a member of the Winfield Presbyterian Church, having served several terms as an Elder in the church; she is also a member of the Presbyterian Women's group and Circle. She has also served on the Board of the Winfield Historical Museum, with a gentle nudge from Nelle Lindell.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	History is another area that Fran enjoys. &quot;My Dad was a Township Trustee at the local cemetery and I have always been interested in the cemetery,&quot; Fran said. For her 80th birthday her friend, Judith Robinette, made her a book that lists all the names of the people who are buried at the Winfield-Scott Township Cemetery. She continues to keep it current. This list can also be found on the Winfield Historical Society's website at: www.winfieldhistoricalsociety.com</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	Fran told me, just as every other person I have interviewed as our Ambassador, that this &quot;is a great honor and I was absolutely floored when I was told I was chosen. I'm still a little in awe of it.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="+1">	Enjoy your special day, Fran, you are very deserving of this award.</FONT></P>
