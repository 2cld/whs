has flown by and it is membership renewal time already! &nbsp;We
continue, with your support, to have a museum and historical society in
Winfield. &nbsp;Your support is necessary and greatly appreciated.</big><br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">As we look back over the past year, we
are saddened by the loss of founding board member Bill Klopfenstein.
&nbsp;He is greatly missed and was an invaluable historian and
researcher. &nbsp;He wrote many of our booklets and also, with Gary
Miller's help, made our prized replica of the 1911 Curtis Pusher
Biplane that landed in Winfield.</big><br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">We were very happy to have Janet
Everett and Gary Huston on our board this year. &nbsp;They are a great
addition to our efforts. &nbsp;Steve Klopfenstein will be joining us
this year as a new board member. &nbsp;We also worked on updating our
by-laws and web site. &nbsp;Judith Robinette continues to oversee the
website and facebook page. &nbsp;She does a great job so please take
time to visit our sites.</big><br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Erickson's Toy Room got a new wall and
we hope to paint the floor soon. &nbsp;Thanks to Gary Long and Gary
Huston for that work. &nbsp;The store room also is getting cleaned and
is an ongoing job to keep organized.</big><br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">This year we will be removing the Civil
War display and replacing it with World War I memorabilia. &nbsp;If you
haven't seen the Civil War items yet, be sure to stop in and see it
while you still can. &nbsp;We will be sponsoring a program on World War
I this winter at a date to be determined.</big><br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">We are always very happy to get new
things to display. &nbsp;Please keep us in mind. &nbsp;We are proud of
the items we received from the Dr. Chance andMarjorie Hull estates.
&nbsp;We also hosted the Model A Car Club, from Cedar Rapids this past
September.</big><br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">2016 looks to be a great year with more
of our history to share. &nbsp;Please take advantage of all we have at
the museum and help us to continue our efforts. &nbsp;There is much to
be learned by the life and times of days gone by, let us save our
history together.</big><br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Visit
the museum on Mondays from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. &nbsp;Our web-site
