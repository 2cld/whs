<P><B><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Greetings,</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Our yearly membership drive is underway for 2006.  We look forward to hearing from past supporters and hope that new members will join our efforts.  In our fast pace world we believe it's important to have a place in Winfield that is dedicated to preserving our heritage and local history.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">2005 was largely spent completing Phase I of the Reconnaissance Survey.  Thanks to all who helped on that big project!  The state has asked us to hold off for a little while on Phase II as they are backlogged.  Take a breather!</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">The museum has recently purchased two new display cabinets and we are in the process of filling them.  We are now better able to display photos and written material.  Please stop by and see the new addition.  We love old pictures, so remember us when cleaning out.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Our Railroad Day programs are always well attended and we look forward to our 7th Annual on Monday, February 20th at 1 p.m. at the school.  Hope to see you there.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Bill Klopfenstein has done an excellent job putting together several new booklets this past year.  We're grateful for his efforts and you can purchase your copies at the museum.  They are wonderful reference material and contain some good stories, too.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Judith Robinette gave a very interesting program on one of Winfield's unsung heroes, Harry Stinson, sculptor.  She did a beautiful slide show of his art work.  We have presented many informative programs free to the public over the years and hope that you've enjoyed them.  Let us know if you have an idea for another.</FONT></B></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="3" FACE="Times New Roman">Your support is vital to our continued efforts.  We invite your input and look forward to serving our community in 2006.  Be sure to visit our web-site at www.winfieldhistoricalsociety.com </FONT></B></P>
