<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">Young's
Cleaners, owned and operated by Mr. And Mrs. Charles Young, in
Winfield, is observing its 50th year in business under the management
of different Young family members.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">Charles's
brothers, Ralph and George Skipton, started a cleaning business in
1921, while they were still in high school. The business was located in
the back of Doyle's Barber Shop (the building which most recently
housed Dr. Kenneth Ross's veterinary practice). Their equipment
included a hand cranked washing machine and a tailor's flat iron.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">In
1922, Ralph graduated from high school and decided to attend Cornell
University at Mt. Vernon. His father, Byron Young, took over the
cleaning business, and moved it across the street into the building
that now houses Crill Upholstery where he added new equipment. In 1928,
Byron built and moved into the structure which presently houses the
business. Charles helped his father in the cleaning shop after school
and during the summers.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">In
1943, Charlie took over the business. During the war years, he worked
at the Ordinance Plant in Burlington along with keeping the cleaners
open for business.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">In
1960, the Youngs purchased new equipment to keep up to date with
cleaning needs. They had an open house that year and about 500 people
came to view their new equipment. Today, they have the latest in
equipment, including three air operated presses, and a steamer to take
care of cleaning all the modern fabrics. The machines circulate the
cleaning solvent at a rate of 60 gallon per minute, a far cry from the
hand cranked machines used years ago. However, it is also necessary
today to use detergents where in the past all that was used was a
cleaning solvent.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">In
addition to serving Winfield, the Youngs also serve several small
communities in the surrounding area. People may drop off and pick up
their articles of clothing to be cleaned at Jim's Barber Shop in
Wayland, Farmer's Union Store in Swedesburg, and Coolie's Drug Store in
Morning Sun.</font></p>
