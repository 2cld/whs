    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">When
asked to write about a place in Winfield that matters, I immediately
thought of our Winfield Historical Society &amp; Museum. It
encapsulates all of Winfield. As President of our society since its
inception, I'd like to tell you a little about us and hopefully inspire
you to visit and appreciate similar efforts in your hometown.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">Our
beginning started back in 1996. As a member of our local Questers Club,
I often mentioned that it would be nice if our town had a place where
our local history and artifacts could be preserved. Several other
Questers seemed to agree and encouraged me to pursue the idea. Laura
Draper, who lived in Senator William Carden's former home, but was
preparing to move, gave me several boxes of memorabilia of the senator
that we found in her attic. They were given with the understanding that
I had to get a museum or historical society organized within two years
or the items were to be returned to the attic where they had been found.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">In
the fall of 1996 Margaret Kant and I put an article in our local paper
for like-minded people to meet at the library. About six or seven came
that first day and encouraged us to keep spreading the word and meet
again. The next month twenty came and so it grew. Many of those
original people are valued board members yet today and it couldn't
happen without their dedication and hard work.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">In
the following months we incorporated; found a building to rent, the
Masonic Temple, and began adding members. We are supported solely by
memberships and donations. As word spread that we needed items relevant
to Winfield our collections began. People were glad to have a place to
share their memories and items from old businesses or people that use
to live in Winfield. We get excited every time someone appears with a
treasured box of "oldies" found when cleaning out a closet or old
pictures that always start a conversation about remember
when&hellip;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">How
fast our rooms have filled! Yet we still encourage more for new and
different displays. We change our window display monthly, so when you
next stroll down our main street, be sure to take a minute to see
what's new at the museum.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">We
are open every Monday, 10 a.m. to noon or by appointment, just call the
City of Winfield at 319-257-6661. Groups or tours are always welcome.
We have a lot of information on hand if you're doing local research or
genealogy. Bill Klopfenstein has written six booklets on Winfield, the
school, churches, etc. These booklets are for sale at the museum.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">Our
displays include railroads, school room, printing press, original hose
cart for the fire department, Senator Carden, dolls, quilts, many
pictures of local businesses and organizations. Our basement is a
recreation of Erickson's Toyland that was there in the 1950s and 60s
and is filled with toys from that era.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">Over
the years we have presented many programs on a wide variety of topics.
Our goal is to inform the community of our history and keep an open
dialogue so that we continue to learn and share information.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">While
Winfield is a rural farming community, we have many surprising former
residents. (Come to the museum and find out who.) Our lives are on such
a fast pace. Things are changing faster than ever before in history. It
is vital to have a place where the past is remembered, our former way
of life is preserved, and we can learn from those who went before.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">In
1851 the present site of Winfield was open prairie. It was used to feed
deer, prairie chickens, and wolves. Now our local farmers help feed the
world; that's an amazing story between then and now. We have much to
share.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">Please
join our efforts, keep your local history alive for the next
generation. Hope to see you at the museum or on our web-site:
