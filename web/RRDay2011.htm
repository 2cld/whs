<P> <FONT SIZE="+1">WINFIELD - Civil War history and old steam railway trains came to life at Winfield-Mt. Union School as the Winfield Historical Society hosted its 12th Annual Railroad Day on Monday, Feb. 21.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">This year's guest speaker was retired Lutheran minister and railroad historian, Rev. Phil Borleske.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&quot;I've always been a railroad buff,&quot; Borleske said.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Borleske also attributes his father's love of railroads as influencing his own. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The subject of Borleske's presentation was the &quot;Importance of Civil War Railroads.&quot; Borleske covered the War from its earliest days of unrest in the South, the debate over the fate of slavery in the expanding West and the building of the Transcontinental Railroad to the assassination of President Lincoln just days following the surrender of Lee. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Winfield-Mt. Union Superintendent Pat Coen presented a welcome to an audience of over 60.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&quot;We're excited to host this every year,&quot; Coen said. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Coen explained that this year's presentation was of special interest to him because he had done his advance officer battle analysis about a Civil War battle and the influence the railroad had in its outcome.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">According to Borleske, railroads were &quot;Lincoln's secret weapon in winning the Civil War.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&quot;The North had them, the South didn't. Just like the North had the telegraph, the South didn't,&quot; Borleske said.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Railroads during the Civil War were utilized by the North to transport men, materials and munitions to the front in the South.  Railroads were also frequent targets for both the North and South.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">According to Borleske, the North would routinely destroy southern railroads and rebuild them for use on the front.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">In the case of Sherman's March, Union troops formed what became known as &quot;Sherman's Hairpins.&quot; The lightweight iron rails would be heated and bent around trees so that Southern forces could not straighten and reuse them. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Of local interest, was Borleske's information on the transporting of Camp Harlan troops. Troops were transported by rail from Burlington to Mt. Pleasant and back again, rather than by the existing Plank Road. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">According to Borleske, Iowa had more volunteers than any other state and the only railroad to serve both North and South was the Illinois Central Railroad. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Borleske was pastor at the Swedesburg Lutheran Church from December of 1997 until his retirement in 2007. He now resides with his wife in Vinton, near Cedar Rapids and is working on a book about Henry County railroads. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">&quot;Some contributors to the project are here today,&quot; Borleske stated of the book project. &quot;I've been working on it for about 10 years.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Borleske coauthored volumes three and four of  &quot;Chicago and Northwest in Color.&quot; Volume four is anticipated to be released in about a year, Borleske said.</FONT></P>
