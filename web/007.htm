Face-to-Face Interview Tips:
<P>What to wear?</P>
</B></FONT>
<P><B>Male:</B> Dark suit, black polished shoes, black socks, contrasting tie...or, nice slacks with white shirt, tie and polished shoes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Female:</B> Business suit, white/ivory blouse, matching shoes and hosiery. Avoid excessive makeup, jewelry, hairspray, perfumes or colognes. A good rule of thumb is to not wear anything too tight, too short or too revealing. The more conservative the better.</P>
 
<P><B>Always arrive early!</B> At least 10 minutes. Do not smoke for two hours prior to interview.</P>
<P><B>First Impression! </B>Body language: firm handshake, direct eye contact, sit up straight and SMILE.</P>
<P><B>Positive Mental Attitude! </B>Stay focused on getting the offer. Any concerns can be addressed at the end of your final interview.</P>
<P><B>Be prepared: </B>Have a written list of questions that pertain to the job expectations only. Questions regarding vacation time, time off, benefits, etc., should only be discussed if brought up by the interviewer. Usually these issues are covered prior to a formal offer.</P>
<P><B>Be Ready</B> to answer tough questions. Role-playing or practicing your interview with someone prior can be helpful. Be prepared for such questions as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Describe your background and experiences, or tell me about yourself.</LI>
<LI>What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses?</LI>
<LI>Have you ever had a dispute with a supervisor or coworker? How did you handle it?</LI>
<LI>What was your role in your last position?</LI>
<LI>Where do you expect to see yourself five years from now?</LI>

<P><B>Negotiating Salary: </B>Always let the interviewer bring up the subject of salary first. When asked for a specific dollar amount you are looking for, always try to give a range rather than a specific dollar amount. For example: &quot;I've started positions at as little as $10.00 an hour and as much as $13.00, I would like to start somewhere in between.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Close the Interview: </B>&quot;I am very excited about this opportunity; I think I would be an excellent fit! Thank you for considering me, I look forward to hearing from you!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Remember to ask for their business card in order to write a thank you note. Thank you notes should only be sent however if you are truly interested and want the position and should be sent immediately following the interview.</B></P>
