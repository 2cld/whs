</B></FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>As we begin another year, we seek your interest, your participation and your membership.  This is a key time in the preservation of Winfield history.  It has never been more important, more urgent, than it is right now to gather and preserve the facts and memorabilia of our everyday lives.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>If you=re not already, we invite you to become familiar with Winfield Historical Society and Museum in the Masonic Temple, 114 South Locust. Stop in any Monday 10 a.m. to noon, or join us any fourth Monday at 7 p.m. We would welcome and appreciate your input, help, or support.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>2009 was a good year for us.  We provided the community with fascinating programs and look forward to doing the same in 2010. We've planned a program on Photography Old and New for March 22nd at 7 p.m.  Bob Lindell is finishing a book on the Boy Scouts that we hope to turn into a program.  Monday, February 15th will be our Annual Railroad Day at 1 p.m. in the school gymnasium.  The public is invited. Refreshments are served at all our programs.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>2010 will be fun packed as we hope to get a display case built to house our military memorabilia.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>We will be making a documentary movie of the History of Winfield that we have to present in Mt Pleasant in 2011.  More information will be available as this big project develops.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>All these projects would be impossible without the support received from members and friends of the Winfield Historical Society.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="White" SIZE="4"><B>Please hear our plea and join Winfield Historical Society's endeavor to gather and preserve Winfield's (YOUR) history.</B></FONT></P>
