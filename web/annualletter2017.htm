<br>
It's membership renewal time for us and we look forward to your
support. &nbsp;Our survival depends solely on membership, donations and
memorials. &nbsp;In order for us to preserve our history of Winfield it
is imperative that we acquire new members. &nbsp;Please encourage
friends and relatives to help us in continuing our local history of
Winfield. &nbsp;These are some things that were accomplishments in 2016
and some continued goals for 2017.<br>
