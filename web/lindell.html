    <p><font face="Tahoma"><b>April 26, 2010
It's been a few years since I tromped the hallowed halls of
Winfield-Mt. Union High School, let alone the woods, hills and
waterways of southeastern Iowa as a Boy Scout. But, after hitting my
mental "refresh" command, Sunday's celebration created a rush of
memories. To adapt the oft-heard saying, "You can take the boy out of
the hometown, but you can't take the hometown out of the boy." For
that, I am continually grateful.<br>

    </b></font><b><br>

    <font face="Tahoma">Bob Lindell has been an active
community fixture in Winfield for some time. Sorry; fixture isn't
appropriate or respectful. That sounds like some weathered plumbing or
lighting embellishment. Tour de force might better describe Bob.<br>

    </font><br>

    <font face="Tahoma">Bob's contributions making
Winfield a better community cover a broad range, but one of his
proudest legacies is the work he did with Winfield's Boy Scout Troop
21. Sunday's gathering at the Winfield Veterans Building celebrated the
release of his historical and anecdotal book, "Troop 21: Scouting
history, activities and memories." Bob and researcher, Bill
Klopfenstein, invested hours of joyous time in collecting the bounty of
information contained in this book. Joyous, as I can only imagine the
chuckling and reminiscences this process evoked. I further believe that
many of the saucier stories may not have found their way into this
tome. But just ask the leaders or scouts involved for their
versions&hellip;or, better yet, their defenses. Thanks to editing
support from former scouts, Merrill Crawford (now of Dubuque) and Jim
Chrisinger (now of St. Paul, MN), this book covers one of Winfield's
legacy bricks upon which the community's growth continues to build.<br>

    </font><br>

    <font face="Tahoma">My parents, Letitia and Lauren
Cory, long-time friends of Bob and Naomi, joined me this day. Letitia
and Bob were classmates in Winfield. My former classmate, Pat Fricke,
was part of the vanguard serving up delicious cookies, cookie bars and
beverages. Jim Chrisinger, Merrill Crawford and Mark Underwood were
some of the initial scouting friends I recognized and chatted with. I
failed further testing of my memory, however, as more and more past
scouting friends I didn't recognize appeared. I thank them for their
gracious understanding as they recognized me (I believe they were
tipped off by my mother - not fair!), but whom I didn't recognize. The
pre- and post-presentation buzz of remembrance-laced conversation was
fierce as the Veterans Hall quickly filled.<br>

    </font><br>

    <font face="Tahoma"> My three-summer pilgrimage to
Camp Eastman, a highlight of my scout career, began in 1964. The blur
of merit badges, horses, rifle range, camp fire ghost stories and
sing-a-longs, and more were unwound thanks to Bob's book. Timelines
were set; fellow campers were identified. From the fertile text of this
memoir of Troop 21 sprouted a bounty of boyhood reflections. For me,
this book became an instant touchstone to a vitally important part of
my youth.<br>

    </font><br>

    <font face="Tahoma"> Bob instills his understated
sense of humor in the stories he writes, flavoring many with the little
life's lessons that were the foundation upon which he dedicated himself
for his scouts. As I read the stories, I could hear Bob's voice,
bringing each historical moment and episode to a more colorful life
than simple black and white words on a page. Each entry serves as a
springboard from which past participants could add their own personal
points of view, spinning off onto tangents of warm reflection. Through
this reflection, through learning about other Troop 21 experiences and
history, I learned even more about myself. This special book release
party helped me gain an even greater appreciation for the
character-strengthening lessons scouting provided.<br>

    </font><br>

    <font face="Tahoma"> Bob's presentation was most
assuredly the headline act of the day. With an honesty and respect one
expected, Bob quickly immersed himself into the history of Troop 21,
dating back to 1913. He told of the troop's inaugural major project: a
hike to Keokuk to see the new dam. That initial adventure unknowingly
positioned Troop 21 to be part of history. Bill and Bob's research
connected Troop 21 with an important pending centennial celebration, as
the troop has been asked to participate in Keokuk's plans to celebrate
the dam's centennial birthday in 2013.<br>

    </font><br>

    <font face="Tahoma">Barely referring to carefully
detailed notes, he painted a picture of the importance of Winfield's
scouting legacy. As his narrative moved through the early decades up to
his involvement with Troop 21, he slowly shifted into a more personal,
more reflective tone. He balanced his stories between humorous and
serious, sometimes infusing a story with both. Such was the case when
he and another leader were assigned to watch the perimeter at Camp
Eastman during a potentially dangerous storm, with instructions to send
the scouts to the stone lodge if the situation became more threatening.
Once at their exposed positions, Bob quickly commented to his fellow
scout leader that those in charge neglected to account for their safety!<br>

    </font><br>

    <font face="Tahoma">Several of the scouts who were the
subjects of stories were present, and Bob didn't let the chance for a
veiled "you should have known better" innuendo pass. Everyone
alternately listened intently or loudly responded, and the hall was
often filled with the shared laughter of a community appreciating the
"it takes a village" understanding that Bob channeled so well.<br>

    </font><br>

    <font face="Tahoma"> Towards the end of the
presentation, which earned the standing ovation it received, Bob took
time to recognize past scouts, leaders, scout mothers and others who
were truly woven into this legacy. Even the current third grade Cub
Scout troop was presented by its den mother. Throughout Bob's heartfelt
presentation, he often smiled, he often reflected, and, yes, there were
times when the intense care and passion he held for his caretaker role
with Troop 21 visibly showed on his face. That is why Bob was so
successful with his scouting leadership. He understood the importance
of the troop, the tribe that bonded through ever-shifting dynamics, but
always had a rock-solid foundation upon which to grow. And, that's a
lesson that many former scouts fully appreciated later in life, as Jim
Chrisinger so eloquently commented on after the presentation. The crowd
enthusiastically agreed with Jim's observations.<br>

    </font><br>

    <font face="Tahoma">Bob's closing quote gave everyone
something to take home. "May I leave you with this thought!! Yesterday
is a sacred room in your heart where you keep your memories. Hear your
cherished laughter from another day. You feel the warmth of a hug from
an old friend. From your yesterdays you draw from life's lessons and
encouragement to pass along to others. It is my hope that you may store
some special memories to be placed in your sacred room and draw upon
them to help guide you through some of life's unexpected challenges
that you may face."<br>

    </font><br>

    <font face="Tahoma">In the end, this was a special
moment for a town in celebrating its being, its purpose. On this day,
Bob Lindell was the torch bearer, as we all gathered in communal
appreciation. This rite needs to happen regularly to keep a community
in touch with its identity, and Winfield understands the importance of
these special events.<br>

    <font face="Tahoma"> If you haven't done so, get your
copy of the Troop 21 book. If you have a son, or grandson, or anyone
connected with this vibrant chapter in Winfield's history, send him a
copy. All proceeds support the Winfield Historical Society, which is
doing an excellent job in fulfilling its role as the focal point for
capturing the stories, history and legacy of this vibrant SE Iowa
community.<br>

    </font><br>

    <font face="Tahoma"> If there are missing names, or
references I would have gotten had I still lived in Winfield, please be
forgiving. I will forever, as I always have, carry my memories of
growing up in Winfield, and having been a part of the Troop 21 legacy,
with me. This part of my upbringing continues to fuel who I am, and
always will. </font></b></p>
