M</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">y father, Robert Evans, was a township trustee for twenty four years and the cemetery was his pride and joy. So, I guess a little of his interest in it rubbed off on me.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
The Winfield Scott Township Cemetery is managed by the township trustees and the Winfield City Council.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
On May 21, 1864, one Mary E. Lane deeded a plot of land to the township trustees for $50.00, with the stipulation it was to be used as a cemetery. This Mary Lane was from Fleming County, Kentucky. When I recently discussed it with the County Auditor, we thought there were probably graves on this land already.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
According to the records, some of the earliest deeds were dated 1887, but there are earlier markings on a few stones found in the southeast and south center sections.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Of the early stones is a family by the name of Brewington with stones dated 1844, 1853, and 1864. Barrington appears on stones dated 1868, 1877, and 1863. There is a stone marking the grave of Sam Miller that's dated 1854.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Nan Grimmer's great-great-grandmother, Mary Thompson, died in 1860 and is thought to be the first woman buried here, according to Lindy Chrisinger, according to the Davidson family.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
The McCulleys, who had donated the land on which the United Presbyterian Church was built, were early settlers just north of town. The dates on their stones are 1857, 1858, and 1865.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Also in the southeast section is the Bashford family. They were early settlers of Winfield and there is a street named for them. This street runs for three blocks north from the water tower. The dates on the Bashford stones are 1864, 1879, and 1893.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
The Goodspeeds' stone is the shape of a tree with small log stones on individual graves, dated 1906, 1911, and 1920.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
There are several &quot;tree&quot; stones throughout the cemetery. One of these is in the north center section and is inscribed S. E. Kepper. There is a stone tree in the center section with the name Timmer.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Just west of the main gate, we find Larkins, 1849 and 1859, early settlers from west of town. There are Malones, 1866 and 1868. The Plants, who also lived just west of town, were buried in 1856, 1870, and 1878. Coopers died in 1872 and 1873. Chrisingers were buried in 1871 and 1889. Farrs in 1856 and 1872. Payne in 1860. Deals were buried in 1875 and 1879. The Cooper stone is inscribed: &quot;Of Puritan descent, patriotic, of strong intellect and a devout Christian.&quot;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
The casket is placed in the ground with the feet to the east, the head to the west. It's said, as the sun rises and sets...is the reason most all stones face east and west.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
As near as I can count, there are approximately 2,900 burials in Winfield Scott Township Cemetery, of which approximately 200 are infants.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
There are two hundred and thirty-two war veterans. Fifty-nine are Civil War Veterans. Click </FONT><A HREF="civilwarsoldiers.htm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">here</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1"> for a list of the latter.  The Veterans Post of Winfield puts flags on all the graves on Memorial Day. The graves that have a white cross with a poppy are those of WWI Veterans; they number seventy.  There are seventy-five WWII Veterans, thirteen from Korea and eight from Viet Nam. There are seven graves for soldiers who served in peace time.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
In the northeast section there is a stone with the name John Barr, dated 1898. His epitaph reads: &quot;He was a prisoner of war in the Andersonville prison in the Civil War.&quot;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Also in the northeast section is Julius Jensen who was a brick mason and he built his own stone. In time it fell to ruin and now there is only the base and the name Jensen left. I remember it was of white brick.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Continuing in the northeast section, there is a stone with an open bible on the grave of Reverend John Wilson of England. He died at the age of thirty-six.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Another interesting stone is that of E. D. Young. It is of marble and metal with verses on it. There are a few other like this, also, in the cemetery.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
The stone of George and Lillie Haight are different as the graves are covered with long marble slabs. Mike Honts tells me these are called ledgers and are indicative of a Dutch background.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Some new stones in this area have real farmstead photos on them.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
The Ann Conner stone is another stone tree, dated 1886.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Years ago people bought family plots that would hold ten people. Today, plots that measure four by ten feet sell for $25.00 each. The cost to have a grave dug is $350.00. The cost for cremation is $150.00. Iowa law requires you be buried in a vault. In some cities, people rent a casket, later to be put in a heavy cardboard box and into a vault. This saves the cost of a casket.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Right now we pay $500 per year to have the cemetery mowed in the summer.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
As near as I can recall, the gravel roads were put in in the late 30s or early 40s, and I remember my father helping put them in.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
In the east center section is a stone of blue marble that was imported from Sweden and quite expensive. It is the stone of Harold Lee and his wife - who are still living.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
The oldest person buried here is Carl Lee, who was 101. His grave is across from the Veteran's Monument.</FONT><BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Years ago a man by the name of A. J. Griffin took care of the cemetery, digging and filling all the graves by hand. He mowed with an old reel-type mower and trimmed with a scythe and sickle. Carl Sandquist helped him at times.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
In the center section is a stone of the Gambell family. They are not buried here, but their stone is here. They were missionaries from the Presbyterian Church to Alaska. On their way back, after furlough here in the states, their ship hit an iceberg and sank, taking the husband, wife and daughter's lives. The north and east windows of the Presbyterian Church are memorials to the Gambell family. In 1998, on the 100th anniversary of their deaths, the back room of the sanctuary was named the Gambell Memorial Chapel. There is an island named for them in Alaska.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">

The largest stone is Levi Metzger, in the north center section, near the drive, at the west end. He was a cattle man and farmer northeast of Winfield. Also in this section is the only stone in the cemetery that faces north and south. It is the Ridgeway stone. I asked Walker Evans about it one time and he said, &quot;The Ridgeways were always a little different.&quot;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
David Bridges was the oldest buried here until 1999. He was 100 years old when he died in 1958. He was the man that brought the mail from the depots to the post office.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
Also in the north center, toward the northwest corner, is the stone of George Ott. He died during the depression and there wasn't any money for a stone. In the late 30s, the railroad brought in some small marble chunks to keep the roadbed from washing. The two Ott sons and a friend took a coaster wagon and brought a stone up and put it at their father's grave. Years later, there was a man engraving dates on several stones and when he heard this story, he asked where the stone was. He said, &quot;If the boys went to that much work, the least I can do is engrave the name and date.&quot; Which he did. Years later, when the Ott boys mother passed away, her stone was a close match to her husband's.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
In the northwest section is the grave of Myer Pavsner. His stone has the Star of David on it. I understand he came to the united States when he was three, the son of Russian Jews. His widow, Mary, still lives here in Winfield.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
In the southwest section is the grave of Dwight Shahan, 1957 - 1971. On his tombstone it says, &quot;He loved life, his fellow man and nature, was killed by a drunken driver.&quot;</FONT><BR>
<BR>

Today a lot of newer stones have pictures of farmsteads, or trucks, or tractors, golfers, some even a portrait of the deceased. Some have the names of their children and wedding dates.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
There are two burial sites outside of the cemetery. One is in the timber west of where Terry and Page Kepper Cornick live. Click </FONT><A HREF="aerialview.htm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">here</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1"> for an arial view of this timber location.  They were the Hockrietors, early settlers here, related to Briggs. A couple stones from the timber have been moved to the cemetery inscribed Bartholomew Hockrietor, 1870, age 82; and Eliza, 1872, age 60. (Others buried in the Hochreiter or Kepper Cemetery, Scott Township, Henry County, Iowa, Section 9 areWilliam H.

In the northeast section the stone of Phyllis (Chrisinger) Volkens says: &quot;She wasn't always right, but she was never wrong.&quot;</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="Black" SIZE="+1">
I wish I could have garnered information on every stone in the cemetery, but not all who lie beneath the stones have relatives to tell interesting stories of the lives they led.<BR>
