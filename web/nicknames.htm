<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="+1">It seems most small towns have their share of nicknames. Not only the kids, but also adults. In our town there was Skeeter, Tick, Cream Puff or Creamy, Cob, Fooz, Oops, Two Bits, Shorty, Goof, Mort, Tooley, Brick, Fiddler, Red, Ike, Swede, Mutt, Bub, Bozzo, Doc, Piz, Coalie, Mile-a-Minute, Jocho, and Knobby to name a few.<BR>
<BR>
Then we can't forget the girls with, Tootie, Butch, Willie, Bugs, Apple Annie, Pudd, Zeke, and Lucky to name a few.<BR>
<BR>
Cob, Shorty and Bub still live in the area and if you were to ask someone, &quot;Quick, what were their right names?&quot; they would probably have to stop and think for a minute.<BR>
<BR>
A few more men were Poozy, Gog, Hotsy, Barney, Muss, Pug, Duke, Bets, Chig, Conny, Len, Chuck, Buck, Sod, Murphy, Socket, Willy, Stack, Brig, Donk, Clabber, Pluge, Skelly, Mont, Mope, and Rock.<BR>
<BR>
A few more women were Peaches, Snoop, Snowball, Fluke, Flossie, Jodie, Lettie, Tess, and Babe.<BR>
<BR>
In looking at some of the things in the Winfield Historical Museum, some of these nicknames  pop up  when remembering things from the past.
