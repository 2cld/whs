<P><B>Greetings,</B></P>
<P><B>We welcome in 2013 as this will be the Winfield Museum's 15th Birthday. Who would have guessed. We could not have done it without the dedication and hard work of all the board members and the support of the community; we are grateful.</B></P>
<P><B>This past year we presented some good programs, including Railroad Days, Lon Simpson on the Civil War, and Russ Fry on the Death of Eunice Rockefeller. We are in the planning stage for this year with some good ideas, so watch The Beacon or listen to KILJ for dates and information. Hope to see you there.</B></P>
<P><B>In 2012 we were presented with a grant to construct new storage closets for our vintage clothes. That project was greatly needed and completed.</B></P>
<P><B>We are always grateful for donations, both financial and Winfield related items. This past year we were very happy to receive some pillars and woodwork out of the old United Presbyterian Church that had been stored in the former Westercamp home. With the help of Charles Phelps, we now have it installed at the museum. We have also painted the front room and hall which gave us a nice new look. We are still working on this project and hope to complete it this winter. We are planning an open house this spring to both celebrate our 15th year and to show off some new displays.</B></P>
<P><B>Your support and encouragement keeps us going. Our mission is to preserve local history and educate about the past to build on the future. Once again we ask for your support. We badly need financial donations, membership dues, volunteer help, memorials, and always pictures and items to be donated. Please stop into the museum any Monday, 10 - Noon, or call 257-6974 for an appointment and we will be happy to open the museum for group tours at your convenience.
